# CapabilityPlots

CapabilitySixpack is a python package that contains 6 different quality control plots
The main goal of this is to mimic a MiniTab capability sixpack
The result is almost identical but you can also call each plot individually. This package
combines a premade package where the actual plotting happens but also contains a GUI and file downloader
